# ml-intro

My notes and experiences in ML with Python, using various tutorials and reference points to develop a better understanding of the machine-learning process, algorithms involved, and more. 

Any of the files/folders can be run stand-alone (I recommend Spyder).

Uses Anaconda as its distribution platform and various built-in packages.
